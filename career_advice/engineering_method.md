# The Engineering Method 

## EXPLORE

1.  come up with your own "happy case" examples
2.  come up with edge cases
  - example of edge cases:
    - negative numbers
    - empty cases (empty array, string)
    - out of bounds
    - cycles in lists

## BRAINSTORM
1. Identify a simple solution 
  - less than 5 minutes
  - spend short time explaining it ( one or two sentences)
  - mention solutions that may not work
2.  Work through some example cases manually 
  - strings of odd and even length when checking for palindromes
  -  binary trees with and without both children, or with and without grandchildren
  - graphs with and without cycles
  - arrays with duplicates/unique or sorted/unsorted If the problem is to find the largest element in a binary tree, try cases where the largest element is in the root, in the middle, or in a leaf node

3. Time and Space Complexity

## PLAN (choose a solution)
## IMPLEMENT
- "I'm pretty confident in this approach now. Do you have any questions?"
## VERIFY 


### Random Tips
-   **Multiple solution**s - engineering is about tradeoffs. Designing more than one algorithm and then choosing carefully shows good engineering judgment.
